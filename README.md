# CodingEventsDemo

## Description
CodingEventsDemo is an app where users can keep track of coding events, such as meetups and conferences.

## Current State
Currently, the app allows users to update and add events, categories, and tags.

## Future Improvements
Future improvements for this app would include adding a Person class that holds the follwoing properties: 
Id, Name, Email, and Location Id. Location Id would be a foreign key that would connect the Person class with 
the Location class. The Location class would be a separate class with the properties of Location Id and Name.
The Location class could then be used to connect users with coding events that are happening in their city or state.
